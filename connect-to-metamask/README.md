# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a simple React WebApp composed by a Connect to Metamask button, which verifies the existence of the Metamask's
extension and then connect the wallet. After the connection there is a Disconnect button for disconnecting the wallet.
If Metamask is not installed, a popup is shown which invites the user to install the extension.
